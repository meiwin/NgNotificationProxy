/**
 *
 * `NgNotificationProxy` is proxy to observing notifications (posted with `NSNotificationCenter`).
 * It allows user of the API to specify target thread to which `selector` of `observer` to be called.
 * Additionally it also prevents crashes that would normally happen if object doesn't remove itself
 * from observing.
 *
 * Following are kind of threads user could specify:
 * - NgNotificationProxyThreadCurrent, invoked in the same thread as thread from which notification was posted. This is the default when not specified.
 * - NgNotificationProxyThreadMain, invoked in main thread.
 * - NgNotificationProxyThreadBackground, invoked in `NgNotificationProxy` background thread.
 * - User defined (by name).
